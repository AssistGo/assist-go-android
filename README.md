# AssistGo! Android App
AssistGo! is a mobile application that makes the communication features of a phone out-of-the-box accessible. The standard Android user interface is overcrowded with unnecessary features and configurations that take away from the primary purpose of a cell phone: communication for daily and emergency use. Android provides users the ability to make their device more accessible with a multitude of accessibility configurations. However, it requires users to be aware of these options and be able to manually adjust them to their needs. This accessibility solution provided by Android creates a large barrier of knowledge.

AssistGo! leverages a simple user interface so users with accessibility issues such as visual impairments, limited literacy, and language barriers can easily access primary functions of communication such as voice/video calls and chat. AssistGo! makes it easy for users to add, edit and remove contacts, in addition to providing in-app translation features so those that may have a language barrier can translate without needing a third party. Users are also able to call the local emergency services without the need to look up the service numbers. At a high level, AssistGo! provides users with a simpler way to communicate.
